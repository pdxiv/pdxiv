# Hi, I'm Frank! üëã

It's nice to meet you. When I was 12, I managed to talk my parents into letting me buy a computer and I discovered how fun programming could be. Many decades later I'm still having fun writing code in my spare time and even as a part of my work!

## üë®‚Äçüíª Private coding projects

These are some of the projects that I've been working on recently.

### üéÆ Text adventure games
* [PerlScott](https://github.com/pdxiv/PerlScott), a game interpreter made by translating the TRS-80 Basic code listing from Byte Magazine into Perl
* [Adventshark](https://github.com/pdxiv/adventshark), a graphical game editor, written in Python3 and PyQt
* [tensodoct](https://github.com/pdxiv/tensodoct), a JavaScript/node.js conversion of PerlScott
* [trombicula](https://github.com/pdxiv/trombicula), a lightweight JavaScript/HTML text adventure interpreter based on tensodoct
* [sk2sadat](https://github.com/pdxiv/sk2sadat), an optimized alternative compiler for ScottKit language files into game data files, written in Perl

### ‚ú® Other things
* [fosfor](https://github.com/pdxiv/fosfor), a functioning proof-of-concept for a high speed "matching engine" for connecting sellers to buyers in financial transactions, written in C.
* [monkey-island-pc-speaker-theme-on-arduino](https://github.com/pdxiv/monkey-island-pc-speaker-theme-on-arduino), a silly little arduino thing originally written to prank a colleague
* [file-web-uploader](https://github.com/pdxiv/file-web-uploader), a simple Go service for uploading files using websocket

None of the above projects are abandoned, and if you‚Äôre using them and you run into some problem, I‚Äôll be happy to help out. The world just has too many interesting things competing for time and attention sometimes and priorities are hard to make.
