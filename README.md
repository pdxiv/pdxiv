# Hi, I'm Frank! 👋

It's nice to meet you. When I was 12, I managed to talk my parents into letting me buy a computer and I learned how fun programming could be. Many decades later I'm still having fun writing code in my spare time and as part of my work!

## Private coding projects

### Text adventure games
* PerlScott, a game interpreter made by translating the TRS-80 Basic code listing from Byte Magazine into Perl: GitHub - pdxiv/PerlScott: Scott Adams adventure interpreter in Perl 1
* Adventshark, a graphical game editor, written in Python3 and PyQt: https://pdxiv.github.io GitHub - pdxiv/adventshark: GUI text adventure editor, compatible with Scott Adams/Adventure International
* tensodoct, a JavaScript/node.js conversion of PerlScott: GitHub - pdxiv/tensodoct: node.js interpreter for Scott Adams format text adventures 1
* trombicula, a lightweight JavaScript/HTML text adventure interpreter based on tensodoct: GitHub - pdxiv/trombicula
* sk2sadat, an optimized alternative compiler for ScottKit language files into game data files, written in Perl: GitHub - pdxiv/sk2sadat: Convert ScottKit to Scott Adams DAT format 4

### Other things
* fosfor, a functioning proof-of-concept for a high speed "matching engine" for connecting sellers to buyers in financial transactions, written in C.
* monkey-island-pc-speaker-theme-on-arduino, a silly little arduino thing written to prank a colleague.
https://github.com/pdxiv/monkey-island-pc-speaker-theme-on-arduino
* file-web-uploader, a simple Go service for uploading files using websocket. https://github.com/pdxiv/file-web-uploader

None of the above projects are abandoned, and if you’re using them and you run into some problem, I’ll be happy to help out. The world just has too many interesting things competing for time and attention sometimes and priorities are hard to make.
